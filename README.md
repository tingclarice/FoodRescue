## Inspiration
Many foods ends up in  a dump pile each year and the amount is only getting bigger. While on the other side, many people are in need of food. This motivated us to create this website.
We noticed that people aren't donating their surplus of food because of the complex steps they have to go through when donating. By that we created a easy to use website for them to donate their surplus of food without any hassle. 

## What it does
Connect people who are willing to donate their surplus of food to food organizations who are going to help deliver the food to the people in need. Donators can easily set up a date and time of when organizations can pick up the food that they are donating. Or they can donate in another way, where they can buy from the local supermarkets we have in our website and have it directly shipped to the people in need.

## How we built it
We used figma for the wireframe, github & replit for the coding platform, and for the website we used html, css, and javascript.

## Challenges we ran into
- Different time zones made it hard for us to work as a team & finishing the project.
- Different style of coding made it hard for us to combine our code together.
- Confusions along the way (in the coding, design, concept, etc).
- Making complex features we want to add in our website.
- Lack of time to finish.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Able to finish this project as a team even with the different time zone and lack of communication.
- Able to create this website accordingly to our wireframe, expectations and vision even with the coding problems we bumped into.
- Able to work in platforms we're not familiar with.
- Our want to learn that helped us get this far.
- Being able to pull of this website even with the time limit.

## What we learned
- How to work as a team
- How to create specific features that we used for this website
- How to time manage.
- New codes and knowledge through the coding process and also workshops.

## What's next for FoodRescue
- We're planning to add a chat feature so the donators can chat with the organizations that are picking up their food.
- A more safe place to donated food.
- Partnerships with local grocery stores so the people who wants to donate can get more food with a lower price for the people in need.
